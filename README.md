# Petrophysics_Code

Unofficial Python implementations of articles published in
[*Petrophysics*](https://www.spwla.org/petrophysics-journal) — the journal of the
Society of Petrophysicists and Well Log Analysts (SPWLA).

Each module translates the key algorithms and equations from a single journal
article into self-contained Python code with synthetic-data demonstrations.
The implementations are meant for learning and experimentation, not as a
replacement for the original papers.

## Requirements

* Python 3.9+
* NumPy ≥ 1.24
* SciPy ≥ 1.10
* scikit-learn ≥ 1.2 (required by `src2024_08`)
* scikit-image ≥ 0.21 (required by `src2023_04`)
* xgboost ≥ 1.7 (required by `src2023_04`)

## src2015_12 — Vol. 56, No. 6 (December 2015)

A carbonate-characterization special issue of four case-study articles (no tutorial): the multiscale spatial heterogeneity and core/NMR petrophysics of the presalt Sag carbonates (North Campos Basin, Brazil); presalt carbonate evaluation for Santos Basin (lithology/porosity, pore typing/permeability, saturation with variable m/n and dielectric textural exponent); petrophysical characterization of the bitumen-saturated karsted Grosmont Formation (Alberta); and rock typing of the giant Tengiz carbonate field (Kazakhstan). This issue's source PDF (~19 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages and the article bodies were read directly; all four articles have full bodies. As carbonate case studies with few display equations, each module implements the standard petrophysics the paper applies; the typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped and are faithful standard-form reconstructions. This issue **predates SPWLA DOI assignment** (the PDF and CrossRef carry none for Vol. 56), so articles are cited by volume/issue/page. See the per-folder README for details.

## src2016_02 — Vol. 57, No. 1 (February 2016)

Five articles — the Best Papers of the 2015 SCA Symposium plus one regular submission (no tutorial) — spanning the impact of reservoir conditions and rock heterogeneity on CO2-brine multiphase flow in sandstone (capillary pressure, relative permeability, residual trapping); estimating water/oil saturations in organic shales from the 2D T1-T2 NMR ratio (with NMRD dispersion models for confinement); insights into low-permeability measurement methods (step-/pulse-decay, steady-state gas/liquid) under the Darcy-Klinkenberg model; a critical review of low-salinity waterflooding (fractional-flow shocks, residual-oil reduction, wettability); and graphical solutions for laminated (Rh-Rv) and dispersed (Waxman-Smits/Juhasz) shaly sands. This issue's source PDF (~10 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages and the article bodies were read directly; all five articles have full bodies. Articles 1 and 4 are experimental/review SCA papers implemented from the standard physics they rely on; Articles 2, 3 and 5 carry numbered relations that survived as inline text. The typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped and are faithful standard-form reconstructions. This issue **predates SPWLA DOI assignment** (the PDF and CrossRef carry none for Vol. 57), so articles are cited by volume/issue/page. See the per-folder README for details.

## src2016_04 — Vol. 57, No. 2 (April 2016)

Five articles (no tutorial), spanning the Reservoir Producibility Index — a log-based metric for tight-oil reservoir quality that treats producible oil as positive and immobile kerogen/bitumen as negative; integrated petrofacies characterization and depositional-environment interpretation of the Bakken shale from core and advanced logs; a new laboratory approach to measuring organic (kerogen) grain density via pycnometry, plasma ashing and TOC regression; a multilevel iterative method quantifying pore-size-distribution (capillary) effects on the phase equilibrium of confined multicomponent fluids; and a method for VTI acoustic-anisotropy interpretation when the Stoneley-wave velocity is missing (V-reg and M-ANNIE 2 closures). This issue's source PDF (~8 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages and the article bodies were read directly; all five articles have full bodies and their numbered relations survived as inline text. The typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped and are faithful standard-form reconstructions.

## src2016_06 — Vol. 57, No. 3 (June 2016)

Five articles (no tutorial), spanning heterogeneous-carbonate subsurface consistency via saturation-height models calibrated to dynamic data; a modified capillary-channel model combining hydraulic and electrical conductivity to characterize carbonate pore space (eliminating tortuosity); permeability interpretation from wireline-formation-tester pressure transients with consideration of effective thickness; an improved multiscale (dual-tree complex wavelet) and leaky-P-removal analysis for shear-wave anisotropy inversion from crossed-dipole logs; and a review of wireline depth quality with an elastic-stretch correction. This issue's source PDF (~13 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies. Articles 1–4 have full bodies and their numbered relations survived as inline text; the typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped and are faithful standard-form reconstructions. Article 5 (Bolt) was beyond the text extraction (the source truncates within Article 4) and is implemented as a methodology proxy from the standard Hooke's-law cable-stretch correction its title describes. This issue **predates SPWLA DOI assignment** (the PDF and CrossRef carry none for Vol. 57), so articles are cited by volume/issue/page. See the per-folder README for details.

## src2016_08 — Vol. 57, No. 4 (August 2016)

Five articles (no tutorial), spanning NMR relaxometry in shale and the relaxation mechanisms (dipolar vs spin-rotation) that set the T1/T2 ratios of each constituent; predicting carbonate rock properties from NMR with radial-basis-function generalized interpolation (and PCA of the T2 distribution); drainage capillary pressure and resistivity index from short-wait porous-plate experiments via exponential-decay equilibrium prediction; low-cost spectral gamma-ray measurement while drilling (sourceless gain regulation and K/U/Th window analysis); and a pure-matrix-GR indicator that removes porosity and bulk-density effects from the GR log. This issue's source PDF (~13 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies; all five articles have full bodies. Many numbered relations survived as inline text (the BPP and spin-rotation relations, the Coates/SDR transforms, the exponential-decay and pure-matrix-GR derivations); the typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped and are faithful standard-form reconstructions. This issue **predates SPWLA DOI assignment** (the PDF and CrossRef carry none for Vol. 57), so articles are cited by volume/issue/page. See the per-folder README for details.

## src2016_10 — Vol. 57, No. 5 (October 2016)

Five articles (no tutorial), spanning electromagnetic look-ahead-while-drilling resistivity for geostopping ahead of the bit; pore-scale-attribute drainage and imbibition water-saturation models in complex tight-gas reservoirs; first-order error propagation as an integral part of petrophysical calculation; advanced dielectric/CRIM log interpretation for Archie parameters in the Green River Formation; and microfracturing for direct in-situ stress measurement. This issue's source PDF (~13 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies; all five articles have full bodies. Many numbered relations survived as inline text (the capillary-pressure conversions and Brooks-Corey imbibition model, the FOEP matrix relations, the skin-depth and CRIM workflow); the typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped and are faithful standard-form reconstructions.

## src2016_12 — Vol. 57, No. 6 (December 2016)

Five articles plus a technical note (no tutorial), spanning shale-fracturing characterization and optimization via anisotropic acoustics, 3D fracture modeling and supervised machine learning; the geomechanics of orthorhombic media; macroscale shale Young's moduli upscaled from nanoindentation; fluid typing and pore size in organic shale from 2D NMR of kerogen isolates; permeability estimation from ultrasonic borehole-image logs in dual-porosity carbonates; and a technical note on normalizing gamma-ray logs across mixed vertical/horizontal wells. This issue's source PDF (~18 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies; all six items have full bodies.

A multiphase-flow / special-core-analysis (SCAL) special issue with five articles (no tutorial), spanning flow regimes during immiscible displacement (Corey relperms vs capillary number, with pore-scale connectivity), relative-permeability effects overlooked in MICP measurements, wettability effects on osmosis as a low-salinity oil-mobilization mechanism, a fast micro-CT study of brine salinity on pore-scale fluid distribution, and a benchmark of four numerical SCAL simulators. This issue's source PDF (~12 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies; all five articles have full bodies (articles 3 and 4 are experimental/imaging papers). The typeset glyphs were dropped throughout (equations are faithful standard-form reconstructions). This issue **predates SPWLA DOI assignment** (the PDF and CrossRef carry none for Vol. 58), so articles are cited by volume/issue/page. See the per-folder README for details.

## src2017_12 — Vol. 58, No. 6 (December 2017)

A digital-log-preparation tutorial and five articles, spanning log preprocessing for automated interpretation, driller's-depth correction by a way-point (thermal + elastic-stretch) methodology, carbonate pore-structure and permeability heterogeneity from MICP and sonic-log frame-flexibility factors, 3D printing of Berea sandstone as a petrophysical tool, the impact of thermal maturity on kerogen density, and the impact of core-cleaning methods on petrophysical measurements. This issue's source PDF (~17 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies; all six items have full bodies (the conference abstracts after p.622 are not implemented), and the typeset glyphs were dropped throughout (equations are faithful standard-form reconstructions). This issue **predates SPWLA DOI assignment** (the President's column says DOIs are about to begin; the PDF and CrossRef carry none for Vol. 58), so articles are cited by volume/issue/page.

This issue's source PDF (~16 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/pages were read from the contents page and bodies; the extract captured the tutorial and articles a1–a6 fully plus a truncated a7, while the two regular submissions a8–a9 (contents-only) are methodology proxies. The PDF carries no article DOIs, so the DOIs were taken from CrossRef — this issue uses the older `10.30632/petro_059_1_*` scheme (not `PJVxxNx`). Typeset glyphs were dropped throughout (equations are faithful standard-form reconstructions). See the per-folder README for details.

The **"Special Issue on Flow Diagnostics"**: a capillary-pressure tutorial, six flow-diagnostics articles, and two regular submissions, spanning capillary pressure from first principles, an acoustic leak-rate model, a nonlinear multiphase production-logging holdup correction, an ultracompact ultrasonic flow-array tool, downhole sand-production rate from piezoelectric grain counting, distributed fiber (DTS/DAS) flow monitoring, two decades of ACG field surveillance, flow-regime-corrected crushed-rock shale permeability (the "λ plot"), and induced-polarization chargeability of rocks with metallic particles. This issue's source PDF (~45 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/DOIs were read from the contents page and bodies; the bodies of all nine items were captured, but the typeset display-equation glyphs were dropped in extraction (only bare equation numbers survived for most articles), so equations are faithful standard-form reconstructions — except Revil et al., whose equations largely survived inline. See the per-folder README for details.

The "Best of the 2019 SPWLA Symposium" issue (articles 1–7) plus regular submissions (articles 8–10), spanning thermal-maturity-adjusted log interpretation, free/adsorbed gas quantification, machine-learning depth matching, net-sand estimation from borehole images, an in-situ "log-soak-log" imbibition experiment, time-lapse micro-CT of mud invasion, a through-casing dual-source acoustic tool, unconventional rock typing, ANN bulk-density prediction, and a through-casing transient-EM conductivity measurement. This issue's source PDF (`Petrophysics_2019_10.pdf`, 15 MB) has a text layer, so titles/authors/DOIs were read from the contents page and bodies; the machine extract captured articles 1–7 fully, truncated inside Article 8 (mid-references), and had articles 9–10 as TOC entries only, so articles 9–10 are methodology proxies (Article 8 uses the standard Amaefule HFU/Winland forms it cites), and the typeset glyphs were dropped throughout (equations are faithful standard-form reconstructions). See the per-folder README for details.

This issue's source PDF (`Petrophysics_2020_06.pdf`) has a text layer, so titles, authors, page ranges, DOIs, equation numbers, variable definitions, and many numeric constants were read directly from the paper bodies; the conversion dropped most typeset formula glyphs (only Article 1's Eq. 1 survived verbatim), so the numbered formulas are faithful standard-form reconstructions from the preserved variables and the standard textbook expressions each paper cites. See the per-folder README for details.

## src2020_12 — Vol. 61, No. 6 (December 2020)

The **"Pulsed-Neutron Logging in the 2020s: Smarter, Faster, and Much More Powerful"** special issue on nuclear spectroscopy — a historical review followed by six papers spanning formation chlorine / water-salinity measurement, self-compensated pulsed-neutron spectroscopy, two multidetector saturation case studies (Malaysia, Indonesia), through-casing TOC and oil saturation from excess carbon (South Kuwait), and gas-pressure assessment through casing. Unlike the scanned issues, this issue's source PDF (`Petrophysics_2020_12.pdf`) has a text layer, so titles, authors, page ranges, DOIs, equation numbers, variable definitions, and many numeric constants were read directly from the paper bodies; the conversion dropped most typeset formula glyphs (keeping the equation numbers and prose), so the numbered formulas are faithful standard-form reconstructions from the preserved variables and constants — except Article 5's Eq. 3, whose text survived verbatim. See the per-folder README for details.

| `article7_sigma_gas_saturation_lowporosity` | Sigma gas saturation in low-porosity shaly rock: the clean (Eq. 1) and shaly (Eq. 2) sigma porosity-balance saturations using the paper's endpoints (Σ_ma 7.5, Σ_sh 27, Σ_w 24, Σ_g 3 c.u.; φ ≈ 12 p.u.), plus the low-porosity sensitivity caveat |dΣ/dSg| = φ(Σ_w − Σ_g) | Wijaya, Aulianagara, Guo, Naibaho, Asriwan & Amirudin, pp. 623–632 |

## src2021_04 — Vol. 62, No. 2 (April 2021)

A regular issue of five papers spanning NMR pore-structure characterization of a complex carbonate, a deepwater-turbidite rock-typing case study, Thomeer/NMR free-vs-bound porosity partitioning, nonlinear-acoustics noncollinear wave mixing for near-wellbore evaluation, and an integrated NMR continuous/stationary fluid-and-contacts workflow. This issue's source PDF has no usable text layer, so the modules were built by rendering the PDF pages to images and reading them visually — the equations are transcribed from the genuinely rendered math (Article 1's NMR relaxation equations, Article 3's Thomeer/Swanson equations, and Article 4's nonlinear-acoustics wave-mixing equations are verbatim). Articles 2 and 5 are a case study and a workflow paper. See the per-folder README for details.

DOI pattern: `10.30632/PJV62N2-2021aN` (N = 1 … 5). The source PDF had no text layer, so equations were read from rendered pages; descriptive articles (2, 5) implement the quantitative relations the papers rely on. See `src2021_04/README.md`.

## src2021_10 — Vol. 62, No. 5 (October 2021)

The special issue on **"Applications of 3D Printing and Synthetic Rocks in Petrophysics, Rock Physics, and Rock Mechanics"** — nine papers spanning binder-saturation control of 3D-printed sandstone porosity, image-processing petrophysics education, original-size carbonate pore replication, 3D-printed mudrock micromodels, fractal characterization of digital rocks, pore-volume compressibility of unconsolidated sands, fluid effects on the elastic properties of printed anisotropic rock, joint-roughness shear behavior, and near-wellbore perforation fracturing. Article 9 was only partly present in the source PDF (truncated mid-results; an experimental study with no equations), so its module is a methodology proxy; and throughout the issue the typeset equations were image-rendered and did not survive text extraction, so the numbered formulas are faithful standard-form reconstructions of the methods the prose describes.

## src2021_12 — Vol. 62, No. 6 (December 2021)

The **"Best Papers of the 2021 Symposium"** issue — ten papers spanning data quality for petrophysical machine learning, variational-autoencoder mineral quantification from spectroscopy, the SEAT eigenvector dip-analysis technique, deep-learning sedimentary-geometry interpretation from borehole images, density-tool breakout detection behind slotted liner, NanoTag cuttings depth correlation, acoustic multistring isolation evaluation for P&A, overbalanced-drilling core damage and correction, integrated tight-gas characterization, and resistivity-based rock physics for mudrock saturation. Articles 9–10 were available only as table-of-contents entries plus the editor's narrative in the source PDF (the extract truncated partway through Article 8), so their modules are methodology proxies; and throughout the issue the typeset equations were image-rendered and did not survive text extraction, so the numbered formulas are faithful standard-form reconstructions of the methods the prose describes. See the per-folder README for details.
